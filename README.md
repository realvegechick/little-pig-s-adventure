# little pigâ€™s adventure
A python-based puzzle game made for my girlfriend.
Use wasd to move, q to quit and r to reset.
Inpsired by many puzzle games I played, including but not limited to: word game, baba is you and classic push box game(though there're no boxes here, for the sake of my girlfriend's gaming ability).
Feel free to play/rewrite it. Hope it brings love to more people.
